How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-- Gives a control to be able to commit only select files from working directory into repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-- Include only those files which are corresponding to one logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
-- Incase of any non-linear changes, wherein we want to introduce a completely new logical change which involves some experimentation, or some new feature, but want to keep the lastest master copy intact - we can branch out

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
-- It takes in both the changes into the commit assuming these changes are independent.
-- Reference is made to the parent copy while making these commits

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
-- Pros : Eases out efforts and makes merge simpler
-- Cons : Assuming that the changes that seem to be independent to git - since involve different lines of code are not implicitly connected and dependent
