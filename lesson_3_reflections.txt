When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
-- For two reasons : 1. Either to back-up already existing code/work
--                 2. To share code/work with other individuals

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-- To have control on which exact changes we want to pull in

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
-- Branches exist on same repository. Used when working together on a group project so that everyone can contribute or
--                                    used when want to develop individually without sharing

-- Clone can be created from some repository to get exact same code as existed. This is can used to start from already 
                                     exiting code for further development

-- Fork can be made to clone already existing code from Git Hub. However, github maintains all the information on 
                                    who has forked from where. The source developer of the code is not aware of this
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
-- To be able to see any conflicting changes that might have occured on the repository by other contributor with
   with respect to changes we have made
