How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
-- Could help find mis-matching places

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?
-- Can see all the changes that have taken place in the past and can do a comparitive study of the same

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
-- Gives a precise control on what changes made need to be saved/committed, what not. So here all the responsiblity lies with us

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately
-- Git is more used for storing code, wherein we assoicate change with logical difference in the code. 
-- Multiple files can correspond to the same logical change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-- git log gives all the log of the activity done so far
-- git diff gives exact difference between the 2 snapshots to be compared

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
-- We can track the exact change that has been made and can go back and cross-verify the exact change, since we have a log of all this

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-- To create own project space wherein I can do some coding
